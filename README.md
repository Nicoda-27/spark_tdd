# Pyspark Test Driven Development

Following a [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) approach using pyspark is not straightforward.

This set of tutorial aims at implementing a way to do so.

You can browse the tutorials in:

- Chapter 0: Brief introduction to [Why](tutorials/chapter_0_why.md)
- Chapter 1: An opinionated python [Setup](tutorials/chapter_1_setup.md) proposal. As tools evolve very quickly, an up to date setup is introduced.

You can also browse the branches on this repository, each being a step by step approach of how the problem is being tackled.
